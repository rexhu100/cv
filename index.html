        <p1>Hi, I'm Rex. Welcome to my personal page.</p1>

        <p>I am a Data Scientist by training. I finished my PhD in Statistics in 2015, but I have never stopped learning. I obtained an MBA degree to learn about business and leadership, and I taught myself algorithms, web application designs and plenty of other technical skills I find interesting. I will keep on learning, from work, classrooms and anywhere else.</p>
