        <p1>Hi, I'm Rex. Welcome to my personal page.</p1>

        <p>I am a Data Scientist by training. I finished my PhD in Statistics in 2015, but I have never stopped learning. I obtained an MBA degree to learn about business and leadership, and I taught myself algorithms, web application designs and plenty of other technical skills I find interesting. I will keep on learning, from work, classrooms and anywhere else.</p>


        <p>This is an ever-growing list of my technical skills</p>

        <ul>
            <li>R, sparklyr, H2O</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python, pyspark, sklearn</li> 
            <li>Golang</li> 
            <li>SQL Server, Hive</li> 
            <li>Django, Node.js, R Shiny</li>
        </ul>
